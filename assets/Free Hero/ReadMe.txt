//How To Use
VIEWPOINT Overhead Fantasy Free Hero comes with 4 *.PNG pixel art files.

LongHair_BlueTunic_Sword_Shield
LongHair_BlueTunic_Shield
Sword
LongHair_BlueTunic_Shield COMPRESSED

The sword & shield file (LongHair_BlueTunic_Sword_Shield.png) can be used in game with custom hitboxes. The sword and shield are also separated into two files (LongHair_BlueTunic_Shield.png and Sword.png) to be composited in game for more precise hitboxes or rotations. These image files are separated into 48x48 pixel grids. The COMPRESSED file is the same as the shield-only file shrunken down to a 16x16 pixel grid.

The animations are the same for all files.
